## Important

If you use previous versions of RailsBricks, please note that since version 1.1.0, RailsBricks removed the dependency on [RVM](https://rvm.io). It will still work with RVM but it now also works fine for non-RVM users. Thanks to [Nikkau](https://github.com/Nikkau) for the tips.

## Features

- replaces the `rails new` command with `rbricks -n`
- includes useful gems and sets them up for you
- offers two layouts for your site: Reset CSS or Bootstrap 3
- creates and configures a User model from scratch or with Devise
- configures your SMTP parameters both in the dev and prod environments
- inits local and remote git repositories
- ...and much more to boost your productivity!

## Prerequisites

In order to use RailsBricks, you need the following:

- A nix-based OS. That can be any flavour of Linux or Mac OS X. **currently, RailsBricks doesn't run on Windows**. If you are a Microsoft Windows-based Rails developer, have a look at [Nitrous.IO](http://www.nitrous.io) 
- some knowledge of Rails (!)

## Install

######1 - cd to your `<user>` folder:

```
cd ~
```
 
######2 - clone the `railsbricks` repository into `~/railsbricks`

```
git clone https://github.com/nicoschuele/railsbricks.git
```

######3 - Add RailsBricks location to your path in `~/.bash_profile`

```
PATH=$PATH:~/railsbricks
```

## Update

To update RailsBricks to the latest version, just run the following command:

```
rbricks --update
```

## Tip

As RailsBricks will be in your `PATH`, you can simply type a few letters and then press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key. It will autocomplete the name in your terminal. Example:

```
rbr + tab
```

...will autocomplete to:

```
rbricks
```
